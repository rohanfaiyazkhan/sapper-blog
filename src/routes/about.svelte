      Hi! My name is Rohan Faiyaz Khan and I am a web developer working out of
      Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am currently working for
      <a href="https://xen.works" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
        Xen Works
      </a>
      as a Frontend Web Developer where I work with React and Typescript.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate about my craft as a web developer and in free time I
      experiment with a lot things including Svelte, Sapper, TailwindCSS and
      backend development. I blog about the things I learn in order to create a
      self-reference and to share the lessons I learned with other developers.

      When I am not coding I am spending time in my other hobbies such as
      cooking
